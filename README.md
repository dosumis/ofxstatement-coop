# ofxstatement coopPlugin

Plugin for [ofxstatement](https://github.com/kedder/ofxstatement) for
generating [OFX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Financial_Exchange)
from Co-Operative bank statements.

## Status

This is a branch from
[ofxstatement-sample](https://github.com/kedder/ofxstatement-sample)
whose intended use is in developing a plugin for generating OFX files from
Co-Operative bank statements.  It is currently more a statement of intent than a
project.

Note - at the time of writing, the very primitive Co-Op online
interface doesn't even provide a csv option, so csv files must be
generated from text copied from pages.
